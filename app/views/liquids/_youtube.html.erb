<%# This was the <iframe> element that we found was rendering youtube videos onto the page. By also
looking at the youtube_tag.rb file, we figured out how to target this with the ' render "liquids/youtube" ' code
and also that we needed to pass the id, width and height. After doing this, Kim was able to get videos that
were hard coded onto the screen, which was the first card on the project board that we planned on completing on the FE. %>
